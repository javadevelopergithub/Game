Gameplay: on a 8x8 (can be change in code) board size two players take turns to select cells of the board. If a player creates 
a square on the board or a rhombus, the player is awarded points based on the size of the figure and a fade animation plays for 
every figure created that turn. when the grid is full the game ends and the player with the most points wins or a the game is 
drawn.

classes:
SquaresClient: the client class, which does all of the gameplay and connects to the server to send and receive moves between 
players. 

SquaresServer: the server class just connects to players and sends moves from player to players. for each game (two connections) 
to the server a new thread is started on the server.
